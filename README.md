# REKOR - An Automated Voice Recognition Application 

This application is a real-time speech-to-text transcription tool that utilizes the Whisper-1 API model for smart transcription and the Translatepy library for translation, which will eventually be added later as I work on this. Whisper enables efficient speech transcription as well as speech recognition even on devices with 6GB or less VRAM. Multiple changes including speech recognition and visual changes to the transcription window will be pushed in the coming days. A wide range of customizations including the desired language of transcription, choosing the model, and microphone options will also be available soon.
